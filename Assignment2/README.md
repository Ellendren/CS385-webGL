# Assignment 2 - Basic Rendering

Student: Luke T. Shoulders

Description: This assignment's goal is to assemble all of our fundamental parts - HTML, shaders, objects, and geometry - together to finally render something.  In this case, we're going to render a cone in normalized device coordinates.  Most of the parts of this project are provided for you, however you'll need to do the assembly.
