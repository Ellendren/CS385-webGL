# Assignment 1

Favorite website [Sadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
- reason: I like the fact that it seems like a very collablotive website, it seems like people leave lots of supportive comments on the submissions. I particaly like the fact that you can see the source code right next the the shader demos.
